# Run

## Locally

To run the server locally, do:

`$ yarn server`

This starts a Node.js server on port 3008, with `nodemon` watching `src` for any code changes.

`$ yarn client`

This starts a React app on port 3007 and watches for changes.

To run both, just do:

`$ yarn start`

# Deploy

The app is deployed on Heroku. For more information about how to deploy, set it up, etc check the [deployment](DEPLOYMENT.md) document.
